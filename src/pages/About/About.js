            I am a front-end developer with an accounting background. In other words,
            I went to accounting school and returned a programmer.

            From the moment I produced "Hello World" in the console of my first
            website, I knew I was hooked. What started with a simple "Hello World"
            has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as time
            goes by. My interest is to build responsive websites and web applications
            with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

            My accounting background greatly contributes to my practical thinking
            process, and increases my curiosity about how individual parts interact with
            each other behind the scene.

            I'm also... someone who sees the margin of one page is off by 3px, and
            wonâ€™t rest until itâ€™s resolved.
