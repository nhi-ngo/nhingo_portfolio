            I started my career as an accountant before venturing into the dynamic
            world of web development. From the moment I produced "Hello World" in the
            console of my first website, I knew I was hooked. What started with a
            simple "Hello World" has become a full-fledged passion that only gets
            more exciting as time goes by.

            I am highly adaptable and driven by learning. If there is a problem, I
            seek ways to fix it. Whether it takes reading a book or learning a new
            framework, Iâ€™ve grown to embrace the challenges that development can
            bring.

            When I'm not coding, you'll find me either running, hiking, or playing
            tennis.
